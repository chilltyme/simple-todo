# simple-todo
This is aimed to be lightweight and powerful To Do application that works across devices.

<h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
This is a gateway project for me to get the basics right for a lot of the inner workings of the web beyond just the front-end. 

My aims with this is to get a better understanding of back-end processes and get the basics of how to work with Node.js and working with a
database and file systems. 

<h2>What features do I plan to add?</h2>

- Full mobile compatibility(if that's even a feature)

- Ability to tag Tasks such as Important, Daily, Shopping, etc. users can customise these tags but some are provided by the application itself.

- Attaching Notes to tasks

- Attaching images to tasks and preferably other media to tasks(Cannot promise this as issues might arise; illegal porn sharing for e.g)

- User profiles 1. Ability to make it so they are publicly taggable or friend taggable 2. Short summary(optional)

- Other users can tag other users to their tasks with their username if they are public or tag their friends enabling the task to be tracked and available to both users' lists.

- Share entire lists to the public/users

- Reminders for Tasks, available throughout platforms, being as non-interruptive in nature as possible as a feature

<h2>Principles:-</h2>

- User privacy being paramount

- No advertisements at all

- Crowdfunded(Donations for servers if it gets big enough with a monthly limit based on transparent costs) and at worst optional premium features that only ask for powerusers to pay. 

- Community and User Feedback for everything and community beta testing w/ voting on major changes such as UI overhauls.

<h2>Cross-platform Implementation</h2>

- No such approach as Mobile or Desktop first. 

- Focus on maximising features and access as much as feasible for whatever platform the users happen to be on.

- Equal access indiscrimate of platform to functionalities.

- UI being similar enough across platforms to recognise how everything works as much can be done without compromise.

- Chrome extension development for reminders and task creation no matter what webpage you happen to be on. 

- Utilising Android's progressive app feature and allowing notifications to bring to the user the app without installing it.

- Introducing the mobile app regardless, in case people prefer that/it works better. 

- Using the allow notifications thing of browers with a prompt only when the user decides to enable that feature from settings with reminders in app so they don't miss it.
